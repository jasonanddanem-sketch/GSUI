# GSUI - GearSwap UI & Inventory Organizer

A Windower 4 addon for FFXI that provides a visual gear set builder, inventory organizer, and live gear stat tracker.

## Keybind

## Commands

- `/gsui` - Toggle window
- `/gsui show` / `/gsui hide` - Show or hide

## Layout

The UI has four columns:

1. **Left Panel** - Equipment slots (GearSwap mode) or Bag list (Organizer mode)
2. **Inventory Grid** - Browsable item grid with scroll and filter
3. **Item Tooltip** - Hover over any item to see its full description, augments, jobs, and level
4. **Gear Stats** - Live summary of stats from your currently equipped gear

All panels support mouse wheel scrolling when content overflows.

## Gear Stats Panel

Displays totals from your equipped gear, grouped by category:

- **Casting** - Fast Cast, Quick Magic, Conserve MP, Spell Interrupt Down
- **Haste** - Gear Haste (shows cap at 26%)
- **Pet/SMN** - BP Delay, BP Damage, Pet Haste/Attack/MAB/Accuracy, Avatar Perpetuation, Summoning Skill
- **Melee** - Double Attack, Triple Attack, Store TP, Dual Wield, Subtle Blow, Crit Rate
- **WS** - Weapon Skill Damage
- **Magic** - Magic Atk Bonus, Magic Accuracy, Magic Burst Damage
- **Defense** - DT, PDT, MDT, Magic Evasion, Magic Def Bonus
- **Healing** - Cure Potency
- **Utility** - Refresh, Regen, Treasure Hunter
- **Stats** - HP, MP, STR, DEX, VIT, AGI, INT, MND, CHR, Accuracy, Attack

Stats with known caps (Fast Cast 80%, Haste 26%, DT 50%, etc.) show the cap and display `[CAPPED]` when reached. Stats update live whenever your equipment changes.

## GearSwap Mode

Build GearSwap sets visually. Your current equipment and all equippable items for your job are displayed with icons.

- **Drag** items from the inventory grid onto equipment slots to build a set
- **Filter** items by stat/ability using the dropdown (auto-detects relevant filters)
- **Generate Set** copies a GearSwap-formatted Lua table to your clipboard
- **Remove All** clears all slots for a blank set
- **Re-equip** resets slots to your currently equipped gear

## Organizer Mode

Click the **Organizer** tab to switch. Browse and manage items across all bags.

- **Bag list** on the left shows all bags with item counts. Click a bag to view its contents.
- **Sorting toggle** (top-right of grid) switches between **Gear First** and **Items First**
  - Gear First: equipment sorted by slot, weapon type, item level, equip level; then items alphabetically
  - Items First: items alphabetically, then equipment after
- **Drag items** from the grid onto a bag in the left panel to move them
- **Conflicts** button finds duplicate rings/earrings in the same bag (GearSwap can't distinguish identical items in L/R slots)
- **Scattered** button finds non-equipment items split across multiple bags
  - Dragging a scattered item onto a bag consolidates ALL copies from every bag into that destination

## Mog House

Mog house bags (Safe, Safe 2, Storage, Locker) are greyed out when outside the mog house and become available when you enter. Portable bags (Wardrobes, Satchel, Sack, Case) are always accessible.
